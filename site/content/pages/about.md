# About JAMstackCMS

JAMstackCMS is a overview of the top Content Management tools for JAMstack sites.

Basically any content management tool that can manage content on sites or apps that can be hosted directly on a CDN, can be hosted here.

It’s run by Netlify, a automation service for JAMstack sites and apps, as a way to promote a JAMstack approach to building websites.

This site itself is built with [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo), an opensource boilerplate for Hugo (a site generator). Every day [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) builds and deploys the site. The source-code is available on GitHub and you’re more than welcome to contribute as long as you follow the rules.

### Static Site CMSs

People sometimes ask if static sites make sense for anything beyond a one-pager. This leaderboard highlights the top open source projects, in many different languages, that make static sites not only viable, but an attractive option for creating sophisticated websites!

The typical CMS driven website works by building each page on-demand, fetching content from a database and running it through a template engine. This means each page is assembled from templates and content on each request to the server.

For most sites this is completely unnecessary overhead and only adds complexity, performance problems and security issues. After all, by far the most websites only change when the content authors or their design team makes changes.

A Static Site Generator takes a different approach and generate all the pages of the website once when there's actually changes to the site. This means there's no moving parts in the deployed website. Caching gets much easier, performance goes up and static sites are far more secure.
