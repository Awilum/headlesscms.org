# About JAMstackCMS

JAMstackCMS is a overview of the top Content Management tools for [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org/) sites.

Basically any content management tool that can manage content on sites or apps that can be hosted _directly_ on a CDN, can be included on this list.
It’s run by Netlify, a automation and deployment service for JAMstack sites and apps, as a way to promote a JAMstack approach to building websites.

This site itself is built with [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo), an opensource boilerplate for Hugo (a site generator). Every day [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) builds and deploys the site. The source-code is available on GitHub and you’re more than welcome to contribute as long as you follow the rules.

## Explanation of Categories

### Type: Git-based / Headless / Other.

Here we focus on what type of CMS it fall under.

*Git-based*

With a git-based CMS you are pushing changes to git that then triggers a new build of your site.

*Headless*

A headless CMS is purely API driven. It does need to run every time a site has a visitor, but it’s an external api instead of having to run it as part of your site. These are often great if you have several different apps or sites pulling the same managed content.

*Generator specific*

CMS that needs a site specific generator to work.

### Site generators supported: All, or listed.

Site generators or Static Site Generators are a must use build tool for modern websites. They basically make it much easier to create, build and compile a site. They come and all shapes and sizes, and even though HTML, CSS and Javascript always comes out the other end, the language the site generators are written in varies.

Each project might call for a different generator, so it’s important to know which site generators are supported by which CMS.

### Open-source: Yes / No.
