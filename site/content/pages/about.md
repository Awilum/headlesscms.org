# About JAMstackCMS

JAMstackCMS is a overview of the top Content Management tools for [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org/) sites.

Basically any content management tool that can manage content on sites or apps that can be hosted _directly_ on a CDN, can be included on this list.
It’s run by Netlify, a automation and deployment service for JAMstack sites and apps, as a way to promote a JAMstack approach to building websites.

This site itself is built with [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo), an opensource boilerplate for Hugo (a site generator). Every day [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) builds and deploys the site. The source-code is available on GitHub and you’re more than welcome to contribute as long as you follow the rules.

## Explanation of Categories

### Type: Git-based / Headless / Other.

Here we focus on what type of CMS it fall under.
Git-based means that you are typically working locally and then pushing changes to Git, from where you then push a new build of your site.
Headless CMS’ are purely API driven.

Others are, well, those that aren’t Git-based or Headless.. They include ones like Lektor that works uniquely with it’s own site generator..

### Site generators supported: All, or listed.

Site generators or Static Site Generators are a must use build tool for modern websites. They basically make it much easier to create, build and compile a site. They come and all shapes and sizes, and even though HTML, CSS and Javascript always comes out the other end, the language the site generators are written in varies.

Each project might call for a different generator, so it’s important to know which site generators are supported by which CMS.

### Application:

This is to help you find out what CMS suits your need:
Is this CMS made with smaller projects like blogs in mind (like Google Drive CMS), or is the scope for larger projects...

### Open-source: Yes / No.
