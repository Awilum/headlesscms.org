# The Rules

Everybody is welcome to contribute to JAMstackCMS, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/netlify/jamstackcms) and send a pull request.
Each static site generator is a markdown file in the `source/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new CMSs if they follow the following rules:

*   **Static Site Generation:** No "flat-file CMSs". The program must be able to output a static website that can be hosted in places like Netlify, S3 or Github Pages.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other CMS's in `source/projects`.
*   **Short description:** Keep all the details for the body text, keep the description for the overview page short and sweet.
