## Efficient, Scalable Node.js Server-side Applications

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This allows developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

### Extensible

Gives you true flexibility by allowing use of any other libraries thanks to modular architecture.

### Versatile

An adaptable ecosystem that is a fully-fledged backbone for all kinds of server-side applications.

### Progressive

Takes advantage of latest JavaScript features, bringing design patterns and mature solutions to node.js world.

### The open source platform designed for the future. Build enterprise.
